    <h1>Hello! I'm Jennifer Gonzalez</h1>
    <p>I am a final-semester student in <span class="highlight">Software Development</span>.</p>
    <p>I currently live in <span class="highlight">São Paulo, Brazil</span>, but I’m originally from <span class="highlight">Venezuela</span>. I work part-time and spend much of my free time studying and exploring new technologies. I enjoy coding, solving real-world problems, and spending time with my family. Something interesting about me is that I’m multilingual and love learning about different cultures.</p>
    
    <p class="question">What is your experience with Microsoft Excel?</p>
    <p>I have used Microsoft Excel mainly for academic and organizational tasks, such as creating schedules, tracking assignments, and performing basic data analysis. I’m familiar with formulas, tables, and simple charts, but I am eager to improve and learn more advanced features like pivot tables, macros, and data visualization.</p>
    
    <p class="question">What is the connection between Microsoft Excel and your professional goals?</p>
    <p>As a future software developer, understanding data is crucial. Excel is a powerful tool that helps in organizing and analyzing data efficiently. I believe that mastering Excel will strengthen my ability to work with data, which is essential for both development and decision-making in tech-related roles.</p>
    
    <p class="question">What was the last new app, program, or technology you learned and what did this experience teach you about learning technology?</p>
    <p>The last tool I learned was GitHub Pages, which I used to publish my own website. It taught me how valuable hands-on practice is when learning technology. It also reminded me that with consistency and curiosity, I can quickly adapt to and adopt new digital tools that support my personal and professional growth.</p>
